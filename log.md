# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 26, 2019


**Today's Progress**: Starting over on intro to HTML & HTML5 on freecodecamp. I never logged my progress and needed a refresher.

**Thoughts:** I started freecodecamp a few months back and haven't been as consistant as planned.  I will comit to 100 days of code as I learn front end dev through freecodecamp and other online sources.  Day 1!  Let's go!
